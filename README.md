# Welcome to my repository for learning the Aiogram library!

This repository was created based on the magnificent (in my opinion) guide from [mastergroosha](https://mastergroosha.github.io/aiogram-3-guide/). 
Before studying this material, I already had experience in creating bots on pyTelegramBotAPI. You can [view earlier projects here](https://github.com/NoBadVibes79/bots)

## Repository Usage

You can use parts from this repository to build your own bot. 
In the future, I plan to create bots based on the information from this repository. 
I will also add links to my other projects here.

## Feedback

If you have any questions or suggestions on how to use these resources, feel free to contact me.
[My Telegram](https://t.me/Sad_Manners)
I'm always happy to chat and discuss possible collaboration and development options.

## Environment Variables

You will need the following environment variables to work with the bot:

- **BOT_TOKEN** - your Telegram bot token, which can be obtained through [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- **MAIN_CHAT_ID** - ID of the main chat for moderation and interaction.

Make sure you store these variables securely and do not disclose them.
